            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Cobra Kai is an American martial arts comedy-drama television series and a sequel to the original The Karate Kid films. The series was created by Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, and Hayden Schlossberg, and stars William Zabka and Ralph Macchio, who reprise their roles as Johnny Lawrence and Daniel LaRusso from the 1984 film The Karate Kid.</p>
            <p>The series began as a YouTube Premium original series in 2018, before moving to Netflix in 2020 for its third season. The show has received critical acclaim for its writing, performances, action sequences, humor, character development, and its reverence for the previous films.</p>
            <p>Set 34 years after the original Karate Kid, Cobra Kai re-examines the narrative from Johnny Lawrence's point of view, his decision to reopen the Cobra Kai karate dojo, and the rekindling of his old rivalry with Daniel LaRusso.</p>

            <h2>Plot</h2>
            <p>Thirty-four years after his defeat in the 1984 All Valley Karate Tournament, Johnny Lawrence is now a down-and-out handyman haunted by his past. After he rescues a bullied kid named Miguel from attackers, Johnny is inspired to reopen the infamous Cobra Kai dojo. This reignites his rivalry with now-successful car dealer Daniel LaRusso, who has been struggling to maintain balance in his life without the guidance of his now-deceased mentor, Mr. Miyagi.</p>
            <p>As Johnny revives Cobra Kai, a new generation of students becomes entangled in the decades-old conflict between Johnny and Daniel. Miguel, Robby (Johnny's estranged son), Samantha (Daniel's daughter), and other teenagers navigate high school while learning karate and becoming involved in the bitter rivalry between the dojos. As the series progresses, former Cobra Kai sensei John Kreese returns to reclaim the dojo, further complicating the volatile situation and bringing back more characters from the past.</p>
            <p>The show explores themes of redemption, second chances, and the gray areas between hero and villain, as both Johnny and Daniel struggle with their past and try to guide the next generation, often making mistakes along the way.</p>

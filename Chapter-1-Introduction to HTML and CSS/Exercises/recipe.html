    <h1>Kheer</h1>
    
    <!-- Description paragraph -->
    <p class="description">Kheer is a rich, creamy rice pudding made with full-fat milk, fragrant basmati rice, and aromatic spices. This traditional dessert is especially popular during celebrations, weddings, and other special occasions throughout South Asia. The slow cooking process creates a deliciously thick consistency that's garnished with nuts and dried fruits.</p>
    
    <!-- Ingredients section -->
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <!-- Unordered list of ingredients -->
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup basmati rice, washed and soaked for 30 minutes</li>
        <li>2 liters full-fat milk</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar (or to taste)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup khoya/mawa (milk solids) - optional for extra richness</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder (elaichi)</li>
        <li>A pinch of saffron strands (kesar), soaked in 2 tablespoons warm milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup mixed nuts (almonds, pistachios, cashews), blanched and sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons raisins</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon rose water (gulab jal)</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ghee (clarified butter)</li>
        <li>2-3 whole green cardamom pods, lightly crushed</li>
        <li>Silver varq (silver leaf) for garnishing - optional</li>
    </ul>
    
    <!-- Method section -->
    <h2>Method</h2>
    
    <!-- Ordered list of preparation steps -->
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the basmati rice thoroughly and soak it in water for 30 minutes. After soaking, drain the water completely.</li>
        <li>In a heavy-bottomed pot or karahi, heat the ghee and add the crushed cardamom pods. Sauté for a few seconds until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the drained rice and sauté for 2-3 minutes on medium heat until it starts to look translucent but not browned.</li>
        <li>Pour in the milk and bring it to a boil, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Once the milk comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low and let it simmer. Continue cooking uncovered, stirring frequently to prevent the milk from sticking to the bottom.</li>
        <li>Cook for approximately 1.5-2 hours until the rice is completely soft and the milk reduces to half its original quantity. The slow cooking is essential for developing the rich flavor of kheer.</li>
        <li>Add the sugar and mix well until it completely dissolves. If using khoya/mawa, add it at this stage and mix thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Add the cardamom powder, soaked saffron with its milk, and ground cinnamon. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Mix in half of the sliced nuts and all of the raisins.</li>
        <li>Continue to simmer for another 10-15 minutes until the kheer reaches a thick, creamy consistency (it will thicken further upon cooling).</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and stir in the rose water.</li>
        <li>Transfer to serving bowls. The kheer can be served warm, at room temperature, or chilled according to preference.</li>
        <li>Garnish with the remaining nuts and silver varq (if using) just before serving.</li>
        <li>For an authentic touch, serve with fresh naan or chapati during special occasions.</li>
    </ol>
